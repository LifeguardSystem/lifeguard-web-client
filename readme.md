# Lifeguard Web Client

## Dependencies

The webclient uses `11ty` as its static site generator, `jest` form testing and `prettier` for enforcing a cohesive coding formatting.

## Running the project locally

After installing all the dependencies with the command `npm install`, you can run the project locally with `npm start`, and use `npm build` to build the project. The default port for running the client locally is 8080, so the site can be accessed on the url `http://localhost:8080`.

The built project will be found on the folder `/_site`.
